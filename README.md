# CustomExceptions
An assignment to create user-defined custom exceptions in Java. These exceptions also have a hierarchy and extend one-another. The purpose of this assignment was to pass in a string and determine if the sentence ends with proper punctuation. If not, it would throw an exception depending on what punctuation it ended in.
